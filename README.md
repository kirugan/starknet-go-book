If wanting to add a new translation, follow these instructions:

1. Set up [development environment](#development)
2. Add language to `LANGS.md`
3. Copy the the `en` directory and rename it with the 2 letter language code of the language you're translating to (e.g. `zh`)

5. Set `"root"` to `"./"` in `book.json` if not already set

## Thanks

This book takes heavy inspiration from the amazing [ethereum-development-with-go-book](https://github.com/miguelmota/ethereum-development-with-go-book). We highly recommend checking out this book if you're interested in learning how to interact with the Ethereum blockchain.
