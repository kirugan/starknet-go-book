# Setting up the Client

Setting up the Ethereum client in Go is a fundamental step required for interacting with the blockchain. First import the `ethclient` go-ethereum package and initialize it by calling `Dial` which accepts a provider URL.

You can connect to the infura gateway if you don't have an existing client. Infura manages a bunch of Ethereum [geth and parity] nodes that are secure, reliable, scalable and lowers the barrier to entry for newcomers when it comes to plugging into the Ethereum network.

```go
client, err := ethclient.Dial("https://cloudflare-eth.com")
```

You may also pass the path to the IPC endpoint file if you have a local instance of geth running.

```go
client, err := ethclient.Dial("/home/user/.ethereum/geth.ipc")
```

Using the ethclient is a necessary thing you'll need to start with for every Go Ethereum project and you'll be seeing this step a lot throughout this book.

## Using Ganache

[Ganache](https://github.com/trufflesuite/ganache-cli) (formally known as *testrpc*) is an Ethereum implementation written in Node.js meant for testing purposes while developing dapps locally. Here we'll walk you through how to install it and connect to it.

First install ganache via [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ganache-cli).

```bash
npm install -g ganache-cli
```

Then run the ganache CLI client.

```bash
ganache-cli
```

Now connect to the ganache RPC host on `http://localhost:8545`.

```go
client, err := ethclient.Dial("http://localhost:8545")
if err != nil {
  log.Fatal(err)
}
```

You may also use the same mnemonic when starting ganache to generate the same sequence of public addresses.

```bash
ganache-cli -m "much repair shock carbon improve miss forget sock include bullet interest solution"
```

I highly recommend getting familiar with ganache by reading their [documentation](http://truffleframework.com/ganache/).

[client.go](https://github.com/miguelmota/ethereum-development-with-go-book/blob/master/code/client.go)

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"log"

	"github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/ethclient"
)

func main() {
	client, err := ethclient.Dial("https://cloudflare-eth.com")
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}

	fmt.Println("we have a connection")
	_ = client // we'll use this in the upcoming sections
}
```
