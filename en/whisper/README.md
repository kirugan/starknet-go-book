# Whisper

Whisper is a simple peer-to-peer identity-based messaging system designed to be a building block in the next generation of decentralized applications. It was designed to provide resilience and privacy at considerable expense. In the upcoming sections we'll set up an Ethereum node with whisper support and then we'll learn how to send and receive encrypted messages on the whisper protocol.
